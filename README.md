This is the BASH HW by Brita

So this is the course *From Newbies for Newbies: BASH* 
## BASH! WHY BASH?
So to answer to this question I have gathered some information and created a small video on Youtube:

## FILES AND DIRECTORIES
I have an idea I will put here, some code on echo'ing to file, probably .txt file. And creating directory where to put it.
Prepared some slides, will show code in action with the same online BASH tool that was used in the class.
Video will come.


...to be continued

## EDITING (?)
Not quite sure about this yet :)
